# DSML Model Analysis Notes

During my internship, I worked with multiple computer vision and multimodal models.
Due to organizational constraints, the original code and trained models were shared internally
and are not publicly available.

## Models Explored
- Faster R-CNN – object detection
- BLIP-2 – vision-language understanding
- LLaVA – multimodal reasoning
- MiniGPT-4 – image-to-text generation

## What I Worked On
- Studied model architectures and input-output behavior
- Tested models on sample inputs and analyzed outputs
- Compared strengths and limitations across models
- Interpreted failure cases and discussed performance differences

## Key Learnings
- Trade-offs between accuracy and inference speed
- Challenges in multimodal alignment
- Importance of evaluation beyond raw outputs

This repository focuses on conceptual understanding and analysis rather than full implementations.
